There are multiple ways to contribute to Rock

First and foremost, you can [report bugs](bugreports.html) on the Trac
interface, send comments and suggest enhancements (both positive and negative
ones) to the [rock-users](http://www.dfki.de/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/rock-users) mailing
lists.

One thing that is always in need of contribution is documentation: create new
pages [on the Rock trac](http://rock.opendfki.de) or [update the Rock reference
documentation](documentation.html) on the Rock website.

More advanced users can contribute bugfixes and enhancements to the main Rock
codebase, by either sending patches to the rock-users mailing list or using
github cloning and pull request functionality. We also welcome you to
[publish packages and tell us about them](packages.html) so that they become
part of the Rock package directory.

There is a regular rock-developer video chat where the most importand topics for
are dicussed. Feel free to join even for listening the video chat. The scedule
