Bundles in Rock are collections of all files needed to run a particular robot 
system. 

In practice, bundles are Rock packages and they - most importantly - contain
the following:

 * ruby scripts (to run sets of components) - contained in the _scripts/_ folder
 * configuration files for oroGen tasks - contained in the _config/orogen/_ folder
 * log files - contained in the _logs/_ folder
 * ...

See [the wiki](http://rock.opendfki.de/wiki/WikiStart/Standards/RG7) for more
information on bundles.

Creating the bundle
----------------- 

~~~
rock-create-bundle desired/path/to/my/bundle
~~~

The name of your bundle should, for logical reasons, equal the name of your 
robot. It should be located in a _bundles_ folder in your Rock installation.

Afterwards, you must tell Rock that this is the bundle you are currently
working on:

~~~
rock-bundle-default your_bundle
